- explore Zest with different mutation size
- moving average / scatter plot
- compare the distribution saved/all

# Research Questions

1. How destructive are Zest's mutations in general

2. Can we reduce the destructiveness of Zest mutations via Execution Indexing?

3. Are disruptive mutations beneficial for fuzzing?

4. What is the impact of the havoc effect on fuzzing?


- Understand 0 mutation distance
- Find better viaulization to answer RQ1
- Fix jython generator

- There is a instinct: the reason gf <- small mutations.

Notes for Jython:

- Timeout too short
- Dynamic object creation
